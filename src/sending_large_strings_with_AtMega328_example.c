The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the \nvolcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far \noverhead are myriad formations composed of pure white alabaster, which \nscatter their murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.\nTo one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured \nrock which seems to have been crafted by the Devil Himself.  An \nimmense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, \nburns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit \nfar off to your left.  \nTo the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts \ncontinuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, \nwhich bubbles ominously. The far right wall is aflame with an \nincandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor \nto the already hellish scene.  \nA dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.\n";
